## A weaver of dreams at the loom of the mind

These words inspire me, lol! They are on my first page of the website. It is a quote The words are from family guy, by Tom Tucker referring to Chris Griffin in season 9, episode 8 title "New Kidney in town" 00:10:00 minute

These words were from Meg Griffin though:

>Easter egg - Hope is what gets you out of bed in the morning when it is the day of prom, and you haven't been asked out. Hope pushes the caterpillar through the cocoon and drives the salmon upstream. Your breasts maybe small and your glasses maybe thick, but hope doesn't hold up a mirror. Hope is a horizon we head up for leaving nothing behind but fear. And though we may never reach our goals, it's hope that will save us from whom we once were!

"A weaver of dreams at the loom of the mind" is a metaphorical expression describing someone who is skilled at creating imaginative and fantastical ideas or visions within their own mind.

Here's a breakdown of the metaphor:

- "A weaver of dreams": This part suggests that the person has the ability to construct or create dreams, which can be interpreted as aspirations, fantasies, or creative ideas.

- "At the loom of the mind": This part likens the mind to a loom, a device used for weaving fabric. It implies that the mind is the tool or instrument through which these dreams are crafted, woven together from the threads of imagination and thought.

Together, the expression conveys the idea of someone who is adept at constructing intricate and captivating mental images or ideas, much like a skilled weaver creates beautiful fabrics on a loom.
